# The-Racer-that-codes
Hit it guys! Hope you are ready for the burning races!
The soon to be pro driver and coder! 
If you are a person who had a bad day, then get ready for a blast!
I am ready to fight the Python snakes and the Javascript boss! 
Wish me luck Crews!


UPDATE:
Me and the python snakes and Javascript boss have befriended. 
We will no longer be against.
Also I'm still a racing maniac that crashes in forza
